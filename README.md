# Genome_DNN
classification of suicide marker using genome data
You have to prepare genome data as shape [# of samples, # of features].
You also prepare the label of this data as shape [# of samples, # of label type]
I use the conduct of suicide, depression, and control(normal).
Since the data I used is private, I can't inform this.

Go to run the code.
First, you select the model type, such as NN, DNN, RNN, multilabelNN, etc.
Then, you run sh file according model name.
>> ./model_name.sh 
or
>> sh model_name.sh
Then, check the performance of model!
